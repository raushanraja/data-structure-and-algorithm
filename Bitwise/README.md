#### Usages of Bitwise operator in Programming/Coding

##### AND (&) Operator

- Clearing/OFF a certain bit in a number
- Determining if a number is even or odd
- Counting number of set bits
- Determining if a number is power of 2 or not
- Toggling rightmost 1 bit
- Isolating rightmost 1 bit
- Isolating rightmost 0 bit

##### OR (|) Operator

- Set/ON a certain bit in a number

##### XOR (^)

- Toggle a bit ON or OFF
- Finding a number which occurs odd number of time, <br>out of array of numbers, occuring even number of times

##### Bitwise Left Shift (<<)

- Multiplying a number by power of 2
- Creating a number with a particular bit set to 1

##### Bitwise Rightt Shift (>>)

- Dividing a number by power of 2

##### Other operations using combination of Bitwise Opeations

- Determining if a bit is ON/OFF
- Set/ON a certain bit in a number
- Clearing/OFF a certain bit in a number
- Finding modulo of a given number
- Reversing a binary number
- Creating a mask of trailing zero
- Swap all odd and even bits
- Generating power set of a given number
